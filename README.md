# MeteoroRNN

## Description
This project includes the `MeteoroRNN.py` script, which builds a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict temperature trends. It's designed for ease of use, making it suitable for both educational purposes and future enhancements.

## Requirements
To run this script, you need:
- Python 3.x
- Essential libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

## Installation
Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Install the necessary Python libraries using pip: `pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib`

## How to Run

To run the `MeteoroRNN.py` script, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository or download the script** to your local machine.
2. **Open your command line or terminal**.
3. **Navigate to the directory where `MeteoroRNN.py` is located**.
4. **Execute the script** by running: `python MeteoroRNN.py`

## Additional Notes

- **Data Files and Resources:** Ensure all necessary data files or resources are located in the correct directory. Adjust the script's file paths accordingly if needed.
- **Experimentation:** Feel free to modify the hyperparameters within the script to experiment with different model configurations. This can help in optimizing performance or understanding the impact of various parameters.

## Parameters
learningRate, epoch, sequence_length, hiddenDim, minClip, maxClip, Output_activation_function, Hidden_layer_activation
